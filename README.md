# A convolutional neural network to classify specific urban sounds

This repository has code that is based on the CNN model for urban audio classification of the UrbanSounds8K dataset presented in this [article](https://medium.com/@mikesmales/sound-classification-using-deep-learning-8bc2aa1990b7). Test results can be found in this [link](https://www.comet.ml/guigaoliveira/test/69a400cf02594f69be43c35089434f2c) of comet.ml. The validation accuracy of the model that uses batch normalization layers instead of dropout layers was 94% :smiley:.
